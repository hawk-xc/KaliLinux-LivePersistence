# KaliLinux-LivePersistence
A boot menu in Kali Linux “Live” allows users to enable persistent storage – retaining data on a USB drive on the boot up process – across reboots of the “Kali Live” OS. Persistent data are stored on a USB drive in an unexciting partition that can also have LUKS-encryption enabled.
